# Getting Started

## Install

Made for Developers packages can be downloaded via the internal Mastercard Artifactory.

Before moving further, please make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can install the latest version through Self Service.

If you're planning on using Made packages in a project that doesn't yet use Node Package Manager, you'll have to first create a package.json file. You can read more on how to do this in the npm documentation.

To install, run the following command(s) in your terminal in your project root directory (where package.json lives),you will need to log in to the Mastercard firewall before running this command. This will install all of the packages into the node_modules/@made-mc/ directory.

```
npm install @mc-made/design-tokens@latest
npm install @mc-made/css@latest
npm install @mc-made/icons@latest
npm install @mc-made/fonts@latest
```

As Made. for Developers packages are hosted on the internal Mastercard Artifactory you will need to 
to set your registry to point to the virtual repository in Artifactory called npm-all.

To configure all projects to use the Mastercard Artifactory globally run this the command line.

```
npm config set registry https://artifacts.mastercard.int/artifactory/api/npm/npm-all
```

To temporarily change the NPM registry to the Mastercard artifactory:

```
npm install --registry https://artifacts.mastercard.int/artifactory/api/npm/npm-all
```

### Usage

Once you’ve downloaded or installed the NPM package, you can copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/tokens.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/made.min.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-directory]/mark-for-mc.css" />
```

To import in SCSS, include this at the beginning of your main SCSS partial:

```
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mc-made/design-tokens/web/theme/[theme-name]/tokens";
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mc-made/css/made.min.css";
"[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mc-made/fonts/made-for-mc.css";
```

You can also import the stylesheets with [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties). 
<small><a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=custom%20properties" target="_blank"> ⚠️ Note: IE11 does not support CSS variables</a></small>

`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mc-made/css/src/styles.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mc-made/css/src/made-css-variables.css",`
`[path-to-directory]/node_modules/@mc-made/css/src/made-css-variables.min.css",`
